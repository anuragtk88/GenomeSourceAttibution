# GenomeSourceAttribution
Comparison of source attribution methods for genomic isolates. In this case campylobacter isolates from humans are collected and we try to attribute them to its source. The sources here are wild bird, chicken, pig, cattle and sheep. We compare the performance of the MMD method written in the R language with machine learning super functions from Mathematica.
